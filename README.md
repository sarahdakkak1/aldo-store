# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Shoe Store

## Synopsis

Aldo Shoes is having a huge flash sale online. You provide support to the inventory department. They want to react real-time to various inventory problems as they arise.

You adjust the inventory whenever a new sale is completed. The return value includes the store, the shoe model and the inventory left for that shoe model in the store.

```
{
  'store' => 'ALDO Ste-Catherine',
  'model' => 'ADERI',
  'inventory' => 10,
}
```

`ALDO Ste-Catherine` store sold a pair of `ADERI` shoes. `ALDO Ste-Catherine` now has 10 pairs of `ADERI` left.

## Goal

**Design an interface that would allow the inventory department to monitor Aldo's stores and shoes inventory.**

Hope you’ll have fun with this little test. I know I had designing it.
Go wild. It can be anything you want. I’ve seen results printed to console, displayed on a webpage, and even someone who did periodical database dumps.

Here are a few ideas if you need an extra challenge:

- Add some sort of alerting system, e.g. When a shoe model at a store goes too low, or too high.
- Add a REST JSON API, or GraphQL
- Suggest shoe transfers from one store to another according to inventory
- Your own crazy idea!

Share your repository with us when you’re done.

Happy Hacking :)

## Installation

This projects uses the popular library `websocketd` to send messages.

If you're on a Mac, you can install `websocketd` using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Just run `brew install websocketd`. For other operating systems, or if you don't want to use Homebrew, check out the link below.

**[Download for Linux, OS X and Windows](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd/wiki/Download-and-install)**

Note that a Ubuntu 64-bit version is already bundled here `bin/websocketd` for convenience.

## Getting Started

### Inventory Server

Your WebSocket Server is the tap that aggregates inventories from all stores.

You can run it directly from your own machine.

Run the following to start tapping into the inventory events.

```
(bin/)websocketd --port=8080 ruby inventory.rb
```

You now have an active connection to their stores opened on port 8080.

### Start listening on each event

Listen and react on each event using a WebSocket client.

Various implementations are at your disposal. Whatever floats your boat.

They all work the same way. Provide a method or a block to be executed whenever a new event occurs.

Here are two examples for our favorite languages:

#### Javascript

Open a console on a non-secured page:

```
var ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/');

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log(event.data);
};
```

#### Ruby

##### Installation

```
gem install faye-websocket
gem install eventmachine
```

##### Example

```
require 'faye/websocket'
require 'eventmachine'
require 'json'

EM.run {
  ws = Faye::WebSocket::Client.new('ws://localhost:8080/')

  ws.on :message do |event|
    p JSON.parse(event.data)
  end
}
```
